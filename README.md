# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The main goal of this analysis is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Machine learning and neural networks algorithms were used to analyze the dataset that contains more than 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alpabhet Soup over the years. To be able to complete this analysis. the following steps were done:
    1. Preprocessed data for a neural network model.
    2. Compiled, trained, and evaluated the model, and;
    3. Optimized the model by through modification.
    
 ## Results
 
 ### Data Preprocessing
 
 #### The preprocessing of the dataset was done to remove and identify relevant/essential variables:
     - Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL
     - Feature Variables: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, & ASK_AMT,
     - Neither: EIN & NAME
  
  ### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  
  #### Using the base model created in [Deliverable 1](link here),
